# #         first of all we need a temp arr to store each permutation
# #         and we will also need a way to keep track of which number is already in temp
# #         so we will use map to check if its in temp arr or not
        
# #         so when we add a number in temp we will set its map value to 1
# #         and after recursions we will reduce it to 0 when we pop from temp
        
# #         so flow will be as follows
# #         before that define base case which will be 
# #         if the len of temp is equal to input arr, its a permutation
# #         now we will loop through each number to check if its in temp arr using mapp
# #         if its not there append it to temp, and set its value in map as 1
# #         then to append the next set of digits call recursion with updated temp and mapp
# #         when all numbers are added base condition will be satisfied
# #         store that permutation and return to exit that recursion call
# #         for next permutation we will need to rearrange the digits 
# #         so pop the recent digit and set its value as 0 in mapp
        
# #         now this loop will continue and recursion will move 
# #         and we will get all permutations
